## What StageSwap does

StageSwap gives Zoom one camera to select: **Stageswap Camera**. In the normal **Auto** mode, it compares the selected secondary screen with a saved picture of the screen JW Library shows when no media is playing.

- When the screen matches the reference image, Zoom receives the webcam.
- When the screen changes enough to indicate media, Zoom receives the secondary screen.
- Optionally, when a non-reference image stays unchanged, Zoom receives the webcam with the live secondary screen inset—or the reverse.
- The output selector can also force that picture-in-picture layout immediately.
- When automatic switching is stopped, Zoom receives a fixed StageSwap off screen.

Transitions are blended, and several consistent comparisons are required before the source changes. The published video is fixed at 1280×720 and 30 fps.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> StageSwap is an independent, unofficial project. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by the publisher of JW Library. The name JW Library is used only to describe compatibility.

## Privacy by design

StageSwap watches the selected screen visually. Webcam and screen frames stay on the computer: they are not recorded or uploaded. StageSwap does not connect to or control JW Library, read its text or media metadata, transmit audio, or start Zoom screen sharing.

Anything visible on the selected secondary screen can appear in Zoom while **Auto** or **Screen** is active. Always check the **Zoom output** preview before a meeting.

## Requirements

- 64-bit Windows 11
- A webcam
- A secondary screen used for JW Library presentations
- Zoom with permission to use a camera

Current releases are unsigned. Download only from the [official releases page](https://github.com/NatanSlvdr/StageSwap/releases/latest).

## Get started

1. Download `StageSwap_win64_vX.Y.Z.exe` from the official releases page.
2. Open it and choose **Install StageSwap**. Use **Run once** only for a temporary trial.
3. Complete the five-step guided setup: choose the webcam and secondary screen, then capture the normal JW Library idle view as the reference image.
4. In Zoom, select **Stageswap Camera**.
5. In StageSwap, choose **Auto**, select **Start automatic switching**, and verify **Zoom output**.

Windows may request administrator approval when the virtual camera must be installed or updated. Normal managed launches run without administrator access.

For screenshots, detailed instructions, and a setup success checklist, follow the [complete setup guide](https://github.com/NatanSlvdr/StageSwap/wiki/Setup).

## Deliberate limits

StageSwap is intentionally focused. It has no audio path, OBS integration, 1080p output, HDR tone mapping, general device hot-plug manager, automatic replacement-device selection, or docking and sleep/resume recovery. Webcam recovery retries the saved webcam; screen recovery retries the saved display. See the [technical reference](https://github.com/NatanSlvdr/StageSwap/wiki/Technical-reference) for the exact contract.

## Development

StageSwap is a Rust 2024 workspace pinned to Rust 1.97.1. Platform-independent components can be built and tested on macOS; native capture, deployment, tray, and virtual-camera behavior require Windows 11 x64.

- [Developer guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) — workspace, commands, previews, platform boundaries, and releases
- [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) — runtime, capture, composition, publishing, recovery, and deployment
- [Requirements traceability](docs/REQUIREMENTS_TRACEABILITY.md) — product contracts mapped to implementation and evidence
- [Localization](docs/LOCALIZATION.md) — approved English, French, and Spanish terminology

The project is source-available under the license in `Cargo.toml`. Pull requests are not currently accepted; use [issues](https://github.com/NatanSlvdr/StageSwap/issues) for reproducible bug reports.
